## Introduction

This contains the Phork icon font and some examples. A [live demo](http://clients.phorklabs.com/fonts/) is available. The font was created with [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/) and the selection.json file can be used to import it back there.


## Usage

```
<span class="icon-phork" style="font-size: 48px;"></span>
```
